    <h3>The Future of Web & Application Development </h3>
    <p>
      Prophesizing is no easy task — when looking at social phenomena (and web
      development is a social phenomenon), one knows well not to expect a simple
      linear projection from current events into the future. Gathering data and
      observing trends will always leave some unnoticed facts, some overlooked
      trends, and may very well include irrelevant data that should have been
      ignored. Having said that, making an educated guess will probably be more
      beneficial than choosing to remain completely indifferent and oblivious to
      the future.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "It’s our responsibility as software developers to anticipate what’s to
      come and to deliver long term solutions accordingly."
    </h3>

    <p>
      Web development, as a set of technologies, practices, and institutes, is
      formed mainly by two forces: hardware, or more specifically, consumer
      devices, and the same old eternal pursuit of financial gain. When taking
      the task of predicting the future of web dev, an investigation of these
      two should be our starting point. In the last years we’ve seen an
      explosion in the diversity of consumer devices — smart watches, smart
      glasses, smart speakers, smart TVs, foldable smartphones, etc. — in this
      age of IoT (internet of things), we are hardly surprised when a new
      ‘thing’ puts the “smart” hat on and joins the club.

    <h3>"There is an increase in the diversification of consumer devices."</h3>

    <p>
      In the last years we’ve seen an explosion in the diversity of consumer
      devices — smart watches, smart glasses, smart speakers, smart TVs,
      foldable smartphones, etc. — in this age of IoT (internet of things), we
      are hardly surprised when a new ‘thing’ puts the “smart” hat on and joins
      the club. What does it all mean for us as web developers? A greater
      diversity of devices means a greater diversity of platforms and of types
      and shapes of inputs and outputs. Long gone are the days of a single web
      app (or website) for a limited range of devices, all of them equipped with
      a square and large screen and a web browser. If our aim is to get the
      maximum usage for our web apps, we must plan ahead and make them available
      to a large and unpredictable range of devices. That means, building them
      in such a way that would enable us to customize them easily to any
      existing device but also, to be prepared for the next new thing.

    <h3>"Web & Application development can be far too expensive."</h3>

    <p>
      Software developers are expensive. Good developers are in shortage, and
      the demand for them keeps rising. It is predicted that by 2026, more than
      253,000 new software developer roles will be created in the US alone. That
      means more money spent on highly expensive labor. So far, the market has
      reacted with a few limited actions. We have seen the rise of
      drag-n-drop-low-code kinds of platforms that are geared toward low-skilled
      programmers or implementers. Google App Maker, Microsoft Power Apps, and
      web design platforms like Wix are just a few examples. It seems obvious
      that these platforms, as good as they are, are far from being a complete
      solution to the problem as they are too limited to be widely used. If the
      current trends won’t change we will not only have a problem with expensive
      software but we may also see bad code written by unqualified developers
      for what would turn out to be bad software.
